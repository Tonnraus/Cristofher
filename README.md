Welcome to my Portfolio repository, I hope you enjoyed the App experience. Here you will find how I do work, structure my projects.
I am sure you will find a lot of inspiration in this soup of code :sweat_smile: .

## Principles

#### Setup

How do I code?
Beforehand I do make a dynamic no-code mockup, after a deep analysis a design and algorithm is created. Based on that,
I organize the repository's project structure: folders, pages, bundlers, linters, testing tools, Readme are created.
Following the algorithm created, a backlog is created and tasks are assign to a schedule. In notepad these resolutions will
keep saved, available for others. "Just ask me :)". Also, the issues that will be presenting at the time of making the task are saved in Notepad also.

#### Best Practices

About linters, I use Typescript mainly for a better debug code. Husky, Eslint & Prettier for code structure. Also, comments are
important: when a component is created a short description must be made, the process must be mark by comments. The relations within the
tree components is stablish in a diagram.

## Technologies

#### Main Tools & Languages

Main Language: " Javascript with Typescript ",
Main Style: " Styled Components Library ",
Test: " Jest ",
Bundler: " Webpack ",
Deploy: " Firebase & Github Actions "

#### Packages & Loaders

Here all packages installed and a short short description, one line please.

## Backlog

Here all the main task the App is compose of, Issues presented during this process will be point out, noted and all kind of information used to slove them will be in Notion.

- Transition between pages
- Media queries

#### Issues

1. I want to thanks @alejozepol in Github for helping me out with an issue in a moment when I was developing the App. :)
